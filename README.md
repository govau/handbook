# DTA Technology Handbook

This is a handbook for new technology employees at the Digital Transformation Agency.

The guide is written in Markdown and is managed through this GitHub repository.

## Making changes
This handbook is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). You don't need to have Jekyll installed locally to make changes, but you won't be able to see them locally without it.

The handbook also uses [Gov.au UI-Kit](https://github.com/govau/uikit). If you want to make any significant changes to the styling of the handbook, you'll need [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com).

To propose a change to this guide, you first need to [create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join).

Once you're signed in, you can browse through the folders above and choose the content you're looking for. You should then see the content in Markdown form. Click the Edit icon in the top-right corner to start editing the content.

The content is written in the Markdown format. [There's a guide here on how to get started with it](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

You can preview your changes using the tabs at the top of the editor.

When you're happy with your change, make sure to create a pull request for it using the options at the bottom of the page. You'll need to write a short description of the changes you've made.

A pull request is a proposal for a change to the content. Other people can comment on the change and make suggestions. When your change has been reviewed, it will be "merged" - and it will appear immediately in the published content.

Take a look at [this guide on GitHub about pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).
