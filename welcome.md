# Welcome!

Thanks for your interest in joining the DTA technology community! It's not perfect, but it's a great place to make a difference.</p>

We go to lots of effort to recruit the best talent we can find to help us deliver good public services. We want people who do their jobs well and who know how to be part of high-performing teams.

You're here because you've shown us that you're passionate about using technology to solve hard problems. And we think you're pretty good at it.

We know you're at your best when you've got the space and freedom to keep up with the needs of your users. When you're not constantly waiting for other people to make decisions for you. And that's exactly how we're setup to work at the DTA.

Working in this way needs something more then you might have needed at other jobs.

Trust.

You need to trust that we know what we're doing - mostly. That we've done this before, and we know that it works. This doesn't mean that we're perfect, because we're not. We're always happy to hear suggestions about how we can improve, but give what we're doing a shot first.

We also need to trust you. Which we do. You've shown us that you're clever and capable and we're relying on you to do the best that you can, with what you've got. You're free to make a lot of decisions based on what you think is best.

Don't worry if you make a mistake, but don't try to hide it either.

We can't help each other if we don't trust each other.

Now that's out of the way, let's have some fun.
