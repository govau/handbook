        <p>A government publication on your obligations for public performance and accountability. But we'll need to touch on it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
        <p>It's not a how-to guide for working at the DTA either. You won't learn how to take leave, or catch an uber. <a href="http://intranet.digital.gov.au/">We have an intranet for that</a>.</p>

        <h3 class="uikit-inpage-nav-section uikit-display-3">What this is</h3>
        <p>It's a guide - a friendly introduction to the DTA: a challenging, but very rewarding way to spend your time.</p>
        <p>Specifically, it's a guide for technologists.</p>
        <p>It contains the things we feel are important for you to know and answers some questions we had when joining. It doesn't matter if you've worked in government before or this is your first time, we think there will be something in here for you.</p>
        <p>The DTA is different, probably different to anything you've done before. Hopefully, this guide will help you stay afloat during your first couple of weeks.</p>
        <p>But it's only a guide. If you have any questions that we haven't answered, reach out.</p>
