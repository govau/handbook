# Hello, world!

Take a deep breath, you've made it.

Before you can get cracking, there are a few things that you should sort out.

### 1. Join the #tech channel in slack

**\#tech** is where your technology colleagues hang out. You should ask any tech related questions here.

If you're comfortable, give a **:wave:**,  say hello and introduce yourself.

We have other channels for more specific technology conversations. Checkout #backend, #frontend, #secops and #cloud-gov-au if those communities interest you.

### 2. Get setup with GitHub

We use GitHub.

A lot.

It's fine if you want to use your personal account, but your name will be attached to the work you do. You can create a new account if you like to keep work and life separate.

Let {{ site.hot }} know your account details and you'll get added to our GitHub organisation.

### 3. Learn about how we work

The **\#standard** team run sessions introducing people to the DSS. It's a good idea to attend one.
