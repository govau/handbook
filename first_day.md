# Hello, world!

Take a deep breath, you've made it.

Before you can get cracking, there are a few things that you should sort out.

### 1. Join the #tech channel in slack

#tech is where your technology colleagues hang out. If you've got questions about anything tech related at the DTA, you should ask them here.

If you're comfortable, give a **:wave:** and say hello.

We have other channels for more specific technology conversations. Checkout #backend, #frontend, #secops and #cloud-gov-au if those communities interest you.

### 2. Get setup with github

If you don't have a github account, or don't want to use your personal one, you'll need to create a new one.

Let {{ site.hot }} know when you've got an account, and you'll get added to our github organisation.
