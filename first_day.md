# Hello, world!

Take a deep breath, you've made it.

Before you can get cracking, there are a few things that you should sort out.

### 0. Bring your own device

You can use your own laptop at the DTA. We will give you one if you don't want to use your own.

Most of the people in technology use macbooks, but you can use whatever you like.

### 1. Join the #tech channel in slack

**\#tech** is where your technology colleagues hang out. You should ask any tech related questions here.

If you're comfortable, give a **:wave:**,  say hello and introduce yourself.

We have other channels for more specific technology conversations. 
Checkout:
* **#backend**
* **#frontend**
* **#secops**
* **#cloud-gov-au**


### 2. Get setup with GitHub

We use GitHub.

A lot.

It's fine if you want to use your personal account, but your name will be attached to the work you do. You can create a new account if you like to keep work and life separate.

Let {{ site.hot }} know your account details and you'll get added to our GitHub organisation.

### 3. Learn about how we work

The DTA has developed the [Digital Service Standard](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/) (DSS). It's a common rallying point we use to make government services better. Spend some time reading through it.

We have also developed a [Service Design and Delivery process](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/service-design-and-delivery-process/). It breaks down delivering services into four distinct phases. It's important that you understand what these are.

To get a better feel for how it all works, you can read some completed DSS [Assessment reports](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/assessments/).

The **\#standard** team run sessions introducing people to the DSS. They are usually announced in **#events**, it's a good idea to attend one
