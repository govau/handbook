# What we're using

We're very pragmatic when it comes to choosing technology. We don't have and hard rules about which technologies we use - we trust you to make your own decisions.

We  don't want an explosion of different types of technologies that all do the same thing though. Check around with others in the #tech channel to see what they're using and see if you can standardise.

Here's a look at some of what we're currently using:

# How to choose

There are couple of principles that help us choose which tech to use:

### Least surprise
We want to use technology that fails in predictable ways that we can detect and recover from. Ideally, we'd like to learn from others who have had the technology fail for them before.

### Supported by the community
When you need help getting things done it's important that you can get it, and quickly. Using technology with an active community means there are answers on stack overflow and gists on github. You'll also find plugins for tools and pipelines that help make writing code, and deploying software, easier.

### Cloud friendly
We don't just use the cloud, we live there. Almost everything we do runs on the cloud, and it's important that the tech we use helps us stay there.
Cloud friendly tech can be modified with only a text editor, is configured with files and environment variables, and can be setup without human intervention.
